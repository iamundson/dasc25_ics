Unlike traditional system cybersecurity, there is a lack of guidance for assuring that mixed-reality systems are protected from cognitive attack. Formal analysis results alone will not be sufficient. Ultimately, a comprehensive assurance case will need to be presented. We are therefore defining formative assurance patterns corresponding to the attack patterns in our knowledgebase. The assurance patterns will include the necessary arguments that a given mixed-reality system is protected from attack as well as specify the evidence required to substantiate the argumentsâ€™ claims. These assurance patterns will greatly facilitate evaluation and compliance activities for the broader extended-reality systems community.
