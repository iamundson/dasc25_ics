Effective protection against cognitive attacks in mixed-reality systems requires an understanding of how an adversary may exploit a vulnerability. Currently, there is no public resource that captures and classifies this information. We are therefore building a public knowledgebase, similar to MITREâ€™s Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)~\cite{??}, but specific to the ICS domain. Online publication of the knowledgebase will provide a valuable tool to future extended-reality system developers, independent of the formal rigor they use to develop and analyze their systems.
