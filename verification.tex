We are developing proof engineering methods and tools that support an extensive combination of cognitive, environment, and device modeling formalisms that cover a broad swath of the cognitive attack space. Furthermore, we are developing models of mixed-reality human-machine designs, including aspects of cognitive and logical processes that can be formally analyzed in the context of ICS-relevant missions using these new proof methods and tools.  Because cognitive behavior is inherently stochastic, our approach necessarily involves reasoning probabilistically over models.
